EMC_Barreiro notes
==================

MS049701.BS.204.6.pair1.fastq.gz was originally 204.3.pair2.fastq.gz
(was originally a typo).

Alain provided a bunch of new metadata.  This is only integrated into the EGA templates so far, but will need to be added to allEMC_Barreiro.ods at some point, destined for the mEGAdata.

Mock-infections?

Is there some problem with writing the submissionVALIDATEDResponse.json (can't overwrite or something?)

EMC_Barreiro_1
==============
SubmissionID: 619b421398e252000107d809
"egaAccessionId" : "EGAD00001008359"

EMC_Barreiro2
=============
Because submission2 must reference submission1 samples, prepopulate the sub2 obj_registry with the sub1 aliases (and ids).  Use json_templates/EMC_Barreiro/reference_Barreiro1_samples_from_Barreiro2_submisison.py


Steps and timeline of EGA submissions
=====================================
Due to its large size (~13TB) in excess of EGA ftp server capacity (~10TB), the Barreiro submission needs to be divided into two separate submissions (meaning all four of the steps below must be performed twice).  So far, step 2 of the first of two submissions has been completed.

EGA helpdesk (ega-helpdesk@ebi.ac.uk) should to be contacted after each step, made aware of the progress and asked to speed things up on their end, if possible.  Bear in mind the 5h time zone difference (they are located in Barcelona, on the beach).  They usually answer within 24 hours, but don't work weekends.

Sequence of steps:
1. EMC uploads files to EGA storage server. (~2 days at current bandwidth)
2. Wait for files to be recognized and addressable through EGA submitter portal. (~2 days)
3. Perform programmatic submission. (Fast.  If json metadata is complete and accurate, only an hour or two for testing and verification.  Any bugs cause delays).
4. EGA archives the data files (and removes them from the ftp server). (~2-4 days(?), but this time lag can be very unpredictable).
[Repeat for second submission]


Hello EGA,

It has been a while since we last communicated.  I hope all is well on your end.

When last we spoke (a while ago) I mentioned a data submission I was trying to complete before going on parental leave.  Well, surprises happened and the submission was just now submitted to your server last night.  This is the first of two submissions I am trying to complete (limited ftp upload space meant that two, rather than one, submissions were necessary).

Due to some urgency (and delays) on our end, you mentioned that you could prioritize the processing/archiving of the large data files in your system.  This would free up ftp space for the second submission.

The submission details are:
account: ega-box-209
Submission Description: Genetic drivers of epigenetic and transcriptional variation...
SubmissionID: 619b421398e252000107d809
"egaAccessionId" : "EGAD00001008359",

So, if you can, please prioritize processing/archiving of this submission to liberate the ftp upload server space for the second submission.

Alternatively, if you could temporarily increase our ftp upload server space allowance to about 15TB total, I could begin work on the second submission right away.

Many thanks for your help,
-David Brownlee


Slack update 22-Nov

Hello all,

Review of the Barreiro EGA submission situation:
Due to the large data size (exceeding the 10TB limit of the ftp upload server account), the Barreiro data had to be divided into two submissions.  The good news is that the first of the two submissions was completed over the weekend.

Other progress made:
* Alain's latest (and final) metadata integrated into all JSON templates.
* git commit (repo: mEGAdata, branch: importSpreadsheetData)
* An email was sent to EGA requesting they prioritize the archiving of the data files to create space for the upload of the second half.

Though not yet visible or discovereable through the EGA website, the immutable and referenceable dataset accession of the first half is: EGAD00001008359

As previously mentioned, the path to completion is: 
. Wait for EGA to archive the raw data files and liberate ftp upload server account space.  (The email requesting priority treatment was sent.)
. Upload second half of raw data files.
. Wait for raw files to be recognized by the submitter portal interface.
. Perform a programmatic submission of the second half.  Upon successful submission, the second immutable and referenceable dataset accession will be issued immediately.
.  EGA can then perform the archival and publication of the raw data on their own time.
