These are the templates of the EGA objects.

They have been modified to include the following keys:
"id" - which is not sent to EGA, but holds the id given in the response.
"egaAccessionId" - Not sent to EGA, but holds the value from the resonse after submission.

The directories (samples, experiments, etc.) should not be renamed and follow the EGA API submission naming labels.
