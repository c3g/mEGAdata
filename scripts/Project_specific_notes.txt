Project-specific notes:
=======================

File and path naming 'convention' of the source file directory:
Path: Project/Donor/(third_path_token)/Experiment_type/(tracks|peak_call)/
File: (Donor)_(token)_(Experiment_type)_(Repetition)_(peaks){0,1}.(forward|reverse|narrowPeak|broadPeak|coverage|methylation).(bb|bw)
Note: mEGAdata.experiment_type corresponds to IHEC.assay

(third_path_token) takes on a few forms, depending on the project.  Often it is sample.tissue_type or a cell_type.  Doesn't appear in relevant to 2016 McGill IHEC DH but could have implications for matching public_track to experiment_type.


General thoughts
----------------
What are these called: (forward|reverse|narrowPeak|broadPeak|coverage|methylation).  track_type is not a very good name (since it often means assay), but seems to be used here in public_track.track_type.

There are some repeats in here, designated by file_name containing `Rep_1` (or 2, or 3).  Something will have to be done (marked one as primary, or do we want repeats?)  This is often identified in either the public_track.raw_experiment_type or sometimes the (third_path_token) field.


EMC_Asthma
----------
(third_path_token): Unknown meaning.  _10x and _0.5x sometimes get parsed out of Experiment_type, though it shouldn't be a problem. #TODO verify this.


EMC_BluePrint
-------------
(third_path_token): This values takes the following forms: GR, H3_nTC, Mono or nTC.  nTC (no Template Control?)  So far, this is ignored.

Repeats present.  For instance:
EMC_BluePrint/S000X1/nTC/ChIP_2_H3K4me1/peak_call/S000X1_nTC_ChIP_2_H3K4me1_1_peaks.broadPeak.bb

./EMC_BluePrint/nTC/nTC/ChIP_Input/tracks/nTC_ChIP_Input.bw seems incorrectly named (nTC twice)


EMC_Bone
--------
(third_path_token): Cort_Bone or Trab_Bone.  Probably a tissue type.  Ignored.


EMC_BrainBank
--------------
(third_path_token): Probably tissue types.  Ignored.
EMC_BrainBank/S133/CE_Brain/NChIP_H3K27me3/peak_call/S133_CE_Brain_NChIP_H3K27me3_1_peaks.broadPeak.bb


EMC_Cagekid
-----------
(third_path_token): Kidney types, though possible indications of repeats.


EMC_iPSC
--------
(third_path_token): Always 'iPS'.  Ignored.

What species are these?


EMC_Leukemia
------------
(third_path_token): Always 'PreBC' or 'PreBC'.  Ignored.


EMC_Mature_Adipocytes
---------------------
Donors EG011 -> EG020: No entry in the DB.  These are all ATACSeq (non-core IHEC assay, so maybe best to ignore them).  These missing donor represent about 3/8 of the EMC_Mature_Adiposytes tracks. ATACSeq is an IHEC non-core assay.

Also, EG010 is ATACSeq, but IS present in the DB.  Manually joined.

Using hook that sample.private_name is within public_track.file_name (INsufficiently distinct).

(third_path_token): Appears to be cell types.  Ignored.

'EG006' has a typo: 'SC_Stoma'


EMC_Mitochondrial_Disease
-------------------------
(third_path_token): Always Muscle.  Ignored.


EMC_MSCs
--------
(third_path_token): A mess.  One parsing error effecting raw_experiment_type - manually moved:
EMC_MSCs/454T/MSC_Tagmentation-ChIP_100K/H3K4ME1/peak_call/454T_MSC_Tagmentation-ChIP_100K_H3K4ME1_2_peaks.broadPeak.bb

Will have to examine this project closely.


EMC_SARDs
---------
(third_path_token): Mono or TC.  This looks important, possibly some indicator of repetition, or assay_type.
EMC_SARDs/012/Mono/NChIP_H3K27me3/peak_call/012_Mono_NChIP_H3K27me3_1_peaks.broadPeak.bb


EMC_Temporal_Change
-------------------
(third_path_token): TC, BC or Mono.  Probably a cell_type.  Should ask.

# Also, path & filename seem to have conflicting indicators (H3K9me3 or Input - which is it?)
# EMC_Temporal_Change/BCU1799/TC/H3K9me3/tracks/BCU1799_TC_ChIP_Input_1.bw
