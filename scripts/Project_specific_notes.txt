Project-specific notes:
=======================

File and path naming 'convention' of the source file directory.
Note: mEGAdata.experiment_type corresponds to IHEC.assay
Path: Project/Donor/Experiment_type/(     )/(tracks|peak_call)/
File: (Donor)_(     )_(Experiment_type)_(Repetition)_(peaks){0,1}.(forward|reverse|narrowPeak|broadPeak|coverage|methylation).(bb|bw)

What is this (     ) element?
sample.tissue_type?  I think it can be ignored for now.  Doesn't appear in 2016 McGill IHEC DH.


General thoughts
----------------
What are these called: (forward|reverse|narrowPeak|broadPeak|coverage|methylation).  track_type is not a very good name (since it often means assay), but seems to be used here in public_track.track_type.

There are some repeats in here, designated by file_name containing `Rep_1`.  Something will have to be done (marked one as primary, or do we want repeats?)


EMC_Mature_Adiposytes
---------------------
Donors EG011 -> EG020: No entry in the DB.  These are all ATACSeq (non-core IHEC assay, so maybe best to ignore them).  Also, EG010 is ATACSeq, but IS present in the DB.  These missing donor represent about 3/8 of the EMC_Mature_Adiposytes tracks. ATACSeq is an IHEC non-core assay. 
Using hook that sample.private_name is within public_track.file_name (sufficiently distinct).



EMC_BluePrint
-------------
Extra value in path naming convention.  nTC (no Template Control?)  So far this is ignored.
EMC_BluePrint/S000X1/nTC/ChIP_2_H3K4me1/peak_call/S000X1_nTC_ChIP_2_H3K4me1_1_peaks.broadPeak.bb
This values takes the following forms: nTC, GR, Mono, or H3_nTC

./EMC_BluePrint/nTC/nTC/ChIP_Input/tracks/nTC_ChIP_Input.bw seems incorrectly named (nTC twice)


EMC_MSCs
--------
Extra value in naming convention (tagmentation stuff)
EMC_MSCs/454T/MSC_Tagmentation-ChIP_100K/H3K4ME1/peak_call/454T_MSC_Tagmentation-ChIP_100K_H3K4ME1_2_peaks.broadPeak.bb


EMC_Temporal_Change
-------------------
Extra value in path naming: TC, BC or Mono

Also, path & filename seem to have conflicting indicators (H3K9me3 or Input - which is it?)
EMC_Temporal_Change/BCU1799/TC/H3K9me3/tracks/BCU1799_TC_ChIP_Input_1.bw


EMC_Brain_Bank
--------------

Extra term in path naming.  ie:
EMC_BrainBank/S133/CE_Brain/NChIP_H3K27me3/peak_call/S133_CE_Brain_NChIP_H3K27me3_1_peaks.broadPeak.bb


EMC_SARDs
---------
Extra term in path naming. ie:
EMC_SARDs/012/Mono/NChIP_H3K27me3/peak_call/012_Mono_NChIP_H3K27me3_1_peaks.broadPeak.bb
